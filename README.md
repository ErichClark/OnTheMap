# OnTheMap
A project that uses Parse and REST APIs to take cloud based information and display it on a map on a user's phone. 

Closures and management of the GCD ensure that the app doesn't crash under adverse network conditions. 

This project was assigned for the Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree. 

I have significantly improved the graphical quality of the icons, installed data filters, and triggered automatic refreshes on the TableView and MapViews. 

Network and Data Model singletons have been employed to organize code, and MKLocalSearch is used to find location names and coordinates for posting.
